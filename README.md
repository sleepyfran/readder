# Readder 📖
Read your favorite text subreddits posts based on how much time you have.

Also available as an [iOS app](https://github.com/sleepyfran/readder-ios).

## ⚙️ Building
To install dependencies and run locally simply run on your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
> This project uses `pnpm` to handle JavaScript dependencies, but if you don't want to install it you can use `npm`. Just make sure you don't introduce any new dependencies in the `package.json` without `pnpm`, since the lockfile is **only** for `pnpm`.

This will run the Vite server and you'll be able to reach the page in http://localhost:3000/.
